      Mathematics, the science of structure, order, and relation that has
      evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing
      the shapes of objects. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative
      calculation, and its development has involved an increasing degree of
      idealization and abstraction of its subject matter. Since the 17th
      century, mathematics has been an indispensable adjunct to the physical
      sciences and technology, and in more recent times it has assumed a similar
      role in the quantitative aspects of the life sciences.

    <p className="para">
      In many cultures—under the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits,
      such as commerce and agriculture—mathematics has developed far beyond
      basic counting. This growth has been greatest in societies complex enough
      to sustain these activities and to provide leisure for contemplation and
      the opportunity to build on the achievements of earlier mathematicians.
